"Samsung Galaxy J7 No Contract Phone,  16GB ROM / 2GB RAM, 5.5 Inch - White - (Boost Mobile)","I love this Samsung J7, since it is bigger than the s6 and s7, and as good as my old S5 (as compared in the images). I had no issues charging it or switching it over from old phone to this new phone - via a 4 minute phone call to Boostmobile. Yes, the S6 and S7 have -much- faster processors, but I do not need that for what I do... and so far, after 1 month of use, I absolutely love this phone!. The phone feels great, responds quickly, and looks freaking awesome. Pros: -Great price -AFFORDABLE! -Bigger than most other phones available -Great quality screen Cons: -2 bottom buttons- on side of the main home button- DO NOT light up -Camera is not comparable to that of the S5, S6, and S7 -Overall quality does not feel as sturdy as the other models mentioned (Shell plastic is thinner). After one month of use, I rated this phone with 4 stars. I will be updating this review in about 6 months. REVIEW UPDATE: February 19, 2017 After eight (8) months of owning this phone, and 7 months since this original review, I am back today to continue my review as promised. I am doing 2 things for those of you who are reading this review for the first time: 1) I have added a star to make this a 5 star review! 2) I will explain why I have decided to come back to add this star to my review. Let me clarify that since reviewing this, I have purchased a second one for my wife. I will also list what items I purchased it along with: Mr Shield Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy J7 [Will Not Fit For 2016 Version] - 2-Pack Samsung EVO 64GB Micro SDXC Memory Card with Adapter up to 48/MB/s (MB-MP64DA/AM) Phonelicious SAMSUNG Galaxy J7 Case(Boost,Virgin,TMobile,Metro PCS)Slim Fit Heavy Duty Ultimate Drop Protection Rugged Cover with Screen Protector & Stylus (Navy Blue Matte) Of course, purchasing a case, the Screen protector, and a good quality memory card may also influence how this product has performed. This phone continues to work as expected, and has delivered so far. I feel my investment on this phone has paid off, and my money has been worth. Being a somewhat frugal shopper, I thought I would give this phone a try to since it's price was reasonable for what I was getting. My 1 year old (who is now 18 months) has used and abused this phone. He has thrown it on the floor dozens of times, and has scratched, as well chewed on it. What has happened to the phone so far? - It has gained a large crack, on the screen protector. The phone is still working as it did 8 months ago, and the cheap items I purchased to protected have taken quite the toll. I had originally mentioned that the phone felt ""cheap"", and the thin plastic that it is made out of, is certainly noticeable compared to the quality of the S5, and other S series for that matter. Given that this phone has performed well, continues to deliver, and has outlasted quite some abuse, I made the judgement to give this phone the extra star, since this is a great product to my standards. I plan to come back in June, and review this item again after a full year of use!",5,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Motorola Moto G (3rd Generation) No Contract Phone (Virgin Mobile) - Retail Packaging,"I've had some time to kick my phone around (figuratively and literally), and I'm really impressed with this phone. It's value priced, but still very functional. I switched from a Samsung Galaxy SIII, and I feel that this was definitely an upgrade. While the Moto G3 has less memory (8GB) and storage (both internally, and it only supports up to 32GB SDHC micro card), the better processor makes a huge difference. I don't play games, but I do still run a fair number of productivity apps (the biggest being Polaris Office and TeamViewer) and they benefit greatly from the quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 CPUs performance. The SIII would always hang up when running bigger applications, and would always freeze up when pulling up the SwiftKey keyboard. Some apps were almost unusable on the SIII because of these stutters and freezing (ProCapture was the biggest problem). I'm really impressed at how good the camera sensor is. The color, contrast, and brightness of the screen are also incredible. I've had better luck with 4G data, though I do notice a little less speed on Wifi after losing 5 gHz connectivity. The audio on the phone is an improvement, with the two larger speakers on the front of the device. Call clarity has been about as good as the SIII, in my tests. The phone construction is very solid, and seems very rugged in general. I was very happy with the upgrade, from the Galaxy SIII. For my purposes, it's a great phone. I like that it's water resistant, and it performs very well. My girlfriend ended up upgrading to the same phone, from an HTC Desire 816, and she's very happy with the performance boost. It's definitely NOT a flagship phone, and it's only suitable for lower-end or older games. This is not a power user phone, by any means. The smaller storage is probably the biggest limitation. While it hasn't greatly affected me, as I only have a few big apps, but it's definitely the most profound limitation of the phone. If you don't need the power and space of a flagship phone, but still want a very high-quality all-weather handset, I think this is an excellent option. The price jumps around, so if you wait around for a small discount, this is probably one of the better deals on the current phone market. It suits my needs very well, and - having survived being caught in a few big downpours - has been worth every penny. Sept. 2016 Update: For a few weeks, I was having problems with the SD Micro card becoming unmounted, or write problems on the SD Micro card. I assumed it was loosening up in the case (a problem I had with an older phone). Eventually it would refuse to re-mount, despite all attempts. It turned out the phone was having specific problems with the Samsung 32GB EVO Plus Class 10 Micro SDHC, that several other Moto G3 users experienced. I replaced it with a Class 6 Kingston card, and it's been working flawlessly ever since, without any noticeable decrease in read/write speeds.",5,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEARCASE Women's Long Sleeve Casual Loose T-Shirt Dress,"I just received my dress and I am amazed by it! I'm 5'4"" and 186-188 pounds. I wear a 42C or a 40D bra. Either one works. :) I was terrified but I took a chance and ordered a Large rather than an XL. After reading many reviews I was convinced to at least try the Large. Since it's a Prime item, an exchange or return would be easy anyway. The dress arrived less than an hour ago and it fits perfectly. It is very slimming and can be worn out with friends, church, and most important to me work. The length is just at the knee, maybe 1/2 an inch at the most above it. The asymmetrical cut is interesting in a beautiful way. It does not look like whoever made the dress drank too much coffee and slipped with the scissors one too many times. I'm planning on pairing it with grey knee boots and scarf as in the picture to make the outfit really pop. The material is very soft and although on the thinner side, it's good quality and not see through at all. I hate slips because I live on the GA/SC line and it's Hot! The winters have some colder days but boots, thick boot socks, dress, slip, and a scarf would give me hot flashes! I am investing in boot toppers this year though and now can remove the slip as well. We have a WINNER!!! My husband loves it and said an XL would have been droopy. Curvy girls, this is flattering and hides flaws below the waist. I hope my review is helpful because I rely on them myself when buying clothes. Update as of 3/14/17- I have taken care of these dresses (I have several) and they still look brand new after much wear. They have not shrunk, faded, lost their shape, and there is no pilling. This dress is literally the perfect dress. I stand behind my original review 100%!",5,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mizuno Women's Wave Sayonara 4 running Shoe,"I've only worn these a few days for an hour or so of running, but so far they are light and flexible, very comfortable, and fit as expected. I used to wear wave-riders and I like these better (I'm a neutral runner), they are lighter and more flexible than the wave-riders but provide more support than my Nike Flyknits.",5,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZANZEA Women's Sexy Long Batwing Sleeve Loose Pullover Casual Top Blouse T-Shirt,"I want to be perfectly clear on this review. I am reviewing the ""ZANZEA Batwing Sleeve"" shirt. I have found that on amazon, there are an enormous amount of items that use the EXACT same picture that's used on this item. The reviews are significantly different and the color choices are different too. THE PICTURE: It's a blonde, thin woman wearing grey leggings and a white tank under the shirt. The shirt in the image is artificially colored, meaning the same image is used for all of the color choices but the image was altered to show the different colors. The model is not wearing each color. MY REVIEW OF ZANZEA: I love this shirt. I'm short (5'3"") and wear a Large or XL shirt normally. I'm a 38D. I bought this shirt both in XL (2) and in L. The XL was actually a bit large. the L fits perfectly. It covers my butt which means I can wear this with leggings instead of jeggings, although I wear it with both. It's not thin - it is thick but not bulky like a sweater. The bat wings are long and hang down past my wrists. It's super comfortable. I'm tempted to buy one in every color. I might even order a medium - it's that big. I love this shirt. I have it in black, orange and green (which is more of an aquamarine than a kelly green). WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ITEMS FROM OTHER BRANDS? I have no idea why the picture is identical but the reviews vary GREATLY. the Zanzea seems a big on me but other reviews state the shirt is thin or small and I didn't experience that at all. In an effort to help, I'll post all of the information together. I'll include the brand name, the colors available (not what colors are listed, but the colors I see, which don't really match the description), as well as any conflicting information in the reviews. I hope this helps!

Joopin-Round Retro Polaroid Sunglasses Driving Polarized Glasses Men Steampunk,"Frames are metal, so you can bend them to fit your face a little better. That's what I had to do since my face is small. Definitely polarized. They make the world look nicer than it really is sometimes. They are great size. Not too giant or too small. I am a petite 25 year old female and they fit my aesthetic well. They are dark and shade my eyes from the sun well. They are a bit flimsy but they arent bad by any means. I went to target to look for some before I bought these and they were more expensive and poorer quality. So I am very happy with my purchase.",5,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Van Heusen Men's Poplin Fitted Solid Point Collar Dress Shirt,"I had to buy one of these, regular fit, from a hotel gift shop (for $45) at like 11pm when I had absolutely no shirts for a business event the next day. I then went back to my room and ordered the slim fit from amazon to arrive the next morning. 1. Someone criticized this for being too thin and see-through -- but that's perfectly normal for a poplin shirt, and you see it in ultra-high end shirts like my Yves St. Laurent poplin shirt (I'm talking $300 per shirt). Poplin is a very thin weave, and it's supposed to look silky smooth (compare to broadcloth, oxford etc. which are thick weaves and which look relatively coarse). It's more for summer wear, and works particularly well if you have to wear your suit all day. And yes always wear these with an undershirt (but then again if you're going casual in the summer, no tie and top button open, and you have a good body, then I guess you can just wear it without an undershirt. You see male models pulling off that sort of look). Any way, I can see not liking the shirt. But not liking it because it's too thin and see-through is just off-base. That's what it's supposed to do. 2. But this is not completely perfect. The fit is a little large, so definitely get the fitted (and not normal) and maybe the extra slim if they make that. That being said, I haven't seen what happens to these after 10 washes. 3. The cut is also not super-modern. It's fine though. It's like a normal cut, which you might prefer if you don't want to be too stylish / like a dandy etc. 4. For $20 this is a ridiculous deal.",5,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sperry Top-Sider Men's A/O Boat Shoe,"It takes about 10 hours or so to break this pair of shoes in. And they are comfortable once this is done. I personally got another probably 20-30 hours worth of wearing these until they completed started to suck. They are made cheap and the insoles have came unglued and folded up in both shoes. Less than impressed considering the money I spent on these. I received these on April 24th, and haven't even worn them since the end of May.",1,negative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hanerdun Lace-up Corset Elastic Cinch Belt Waist Belt Three Sizes,"I am really glad I made this purchase. I thought the sides would curl because of its elastic, but it doesn't. the quality is ok and for the money, definitely a win. I have worn it several times and still going strong (no rips or tears). Just to let you know that the back has a velcro strip that holds it together and ...boy does it hold. One more thing about the velcro... if not properly overlapped can irritate any skin it rubs up against. So keep that in mind if you are wearing it with jeans or a skirt with any top that doesn't fit into them (aka crop tops) You really can't be it for the cost. just make sure to size it right, that will be the only problem. I am 5'2 and 110lbs and it fits perfect. As in if it was 1/2 inch smaller, it would be too small or those strings would have had to come undone. I say it's WORTH IT!",4,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Skip Hop Zoo Little Kid Luggage, Monkey","I found in annoying that other reviews made this product seem so small. If I had realized how roomy this luggage actually was, I would have bought the ladybug one for my daughter who is about to turn 8. I bought the monkey luggage for my 9 month old son for an 8 day trip and this has more than enough room. *edited* To be specific I fit: (sizes between 6 months to 12 months) 16 onsies both short and long sleeved 2 shirts 10 pairs of pants 1 sweater 1 hoodie 1 footsie pyjama 2 burp cloths 1 fleece body suite 6 pairs of socks A hooded baby bath towel (the thick kind) 12 bandana bibs And 14 size 4 diapers (in the front pocket) The picture included is of this luggage fully packed with everything I just mentioned.",5,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kate spade new york Small Square Stud Earrings,"Kate Spade accessories always make a style statement. And these oversized Kate studs did exactly that. I was pleased with the size, weight, and overall aesthetic of the earrings. -- With the multi glitter and gold tone metal these studs scream chic! -- The stem of these earings is appropriately sized so it doesn't poke in the back of my ear. -- Check my pics to see how they arrive, they are made in China and they just come in a pouch and ziplock bag. Don't hope for fancy packaging -- And it is 'HUGE' don't think it is Small reading the title. Check the pic. Overall I like the stud but since it is really huge, I wish it was a little smaller.",4,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall I am ok with it, not extremely pleased due to the small size but that is more my fault than theirs, so just make sure you do a better reading than me before ordering and decide if that size is good for you and you will have a nice looking sturdy product.",4,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DEARCASE Women's Tassels Soft Plaid Tartan Scarf Winter Large Blanket Wrap Shawl,"So I’m not happy. This “beige” is not beige it’s icy light blue. It’s pretty. But unfortunately, not what I ordered. And not what was described. I bought this for a Christmas photo shoot. I was unable to order another color before the shoot took place. Disappointed. Color matters. I read reviews with photos & see someone took a photo of the “beige” one & another had the same complaint I have! I just wish I would have known that they never corrected this issue! I figured the error was fixed by now. :( Please update description if “beige” isn’t beige & change to “light blue”. Inaccuracy is misleading & highly disappointing. I will not buy from this company again! Who knows what you will get! Totally bummed. As I’ll have to wear something else to tie in my family’s clothes together... had hoped this was going to be the piece. It was ESSENTIAL! :’( Think again. Buyer beware do not purchase “beige” unless you want icy light blue instead. There is no beige... :( :( :( I learned the hard way. Sadly.

Zutano Unisex-Baby Newborn Cozie Fleece Bootie,"We didnt get the chance to use these much because live in southern Cali and its usually warm here. I purchased for him to wear on early morning or evening runs but I never went on any runs lol. BUT he has actually been able to wear them recently on a trip to Oregon even though they are a bit small, the fabric is so soft that its like a sock even though its a bit small and doesnt fit perfectly in the length they still work. So I loved that! They are also adorable and incredibly soft. The snap closure is perfect because they are harder for little hands to undo or pull off. And there are two snaps for fitting. I may be purchasing again in a larger size if need be. Definitely recommend. I wish they made them with skidders on the bottom for walking around the house in. I have tried skidders and cant seem to find any that we like",5,positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
