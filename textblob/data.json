                "review_text": "I love this Samsung J7, since it is bigger than the s6 and s7, and as good as my old S5 (as compared in the images). I had no issues charging it or switching it over from old phone to this new phone - via a 4 minute phone call to Boostmobile. Yes, the S6 and S7 have -much- faster processors, but I do not need that for what I do... and so far, after 1 month of use, I absolutely love this phone!. The phone feels great, responds quickly, and looks freaking awesome. Pros: -Great price -AFFORDABLE! -Bigger than most other phones available -Great quality screen Cons: -2 bottom buttons- on side of the main home button- DO NOT light up -Camera is not comparable to that of the S5, S6, and S7 -Overall quality does not feel as sturdy as the other models mentioned (Shell plastic is thinner). After one month of use, I rated this phone with 4 stars. I will be updating this review in about 6 months. REVIEW UPDATE: February 19, 2017 After eight (8) months of owning this phone, and 7 months since this original review, I am back today to continue my review as promised. I am doing 2 things for those of you who are reading this review for the first time: 1) I have added a star to make this a 5 star review! 2) I will explain why I have decided to come back to add this star to my review. Let me clarify that since reviewing this, I have purchased a second one for my wife. I will also list what items I purchased it along with: Mr Shield Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy J7 [Will Not Fit For 2016 Version] - 2-Pack Samsung EVO 64GB Micro SDXC Memory Card with Adapter up to 48/MB/s (MB-MP64DA/AM) Phonelicious SAMSUNG Galaxy J7 Case(Boost,Virgin,TMobile,Metro PCS)Slim Fit Heavy Duty Ultimate Drop Protection Rugged Cover with Screen Protector & Stylus (Navy Blue Matte) Of course, purchasing a case, the Screen protector, and a good quality memory card may also influence how this product has performed. This phone continues to work as expected, and has delivered so far. I feel my investment on this phone has paid off, and my money has been worth. Being a somewhat frugal shopper, I thought I would give this phone a try to since it's price was reasonable for what I was getting. My 1 year old (who is now 18 months) has used and abused this phone. He has thrown it on the floor dozens of times, and has scratched, as well chewed on it. What has happened to the phone so far? - It has gained a large crack, on the screen protector. The phone is still working as it did 8 months ago, and the cheap items I purchased to protected have taken quite the toll. I had originally mentioned that the phone felt \"cheap\", and the thin plastic that it is made out of, is certainly noticeable compared to the quality of the S5, and other S series for that matter. Given that this phone has performed well, continues to deliver, and has outlasted quite some abuse, I made the judgement to give this phone the extra star, since this is a great product to my standards. I plan to come back in June, and review this item again after a full year of use!",

Of course its not as good as the s7, but if you don't wanna spend 700$ for a phone, then you can't go wrong with j7. Very good phone for the money. I already bought a couple spare batteries. Pros- Good price, good call quality, fast internet, good camera, good selfie camera, great display, perfect size, great for texting, Great battery life (leave it on power save mode), good speaker, 6.0 marshmallow is great, Cons- No LED notification light, incoming ring tone couple be louder.",

Therefore; I opted for this which is scaled down in terms of processing/memory BUT it's much better quality than the phone I was using for my Boost Mobile account. I had no issues charging it or switching it over from old phone to this new phone - via my online account (I didn't have to talk to anybody to do this and it worked out just great). My hubby has the Samsung S6 which he saved/paid for upfront (no contract at Boost Mobile). Comparing my new J7 to his S6 - well; apples to oranges. His has 2 processors (a quad-core and an octa-core). This J7 has just the octa-core BUT for me is proving to be plenty of processing power along with the 2GB ROM. This was pretty comparable to the ZTE Warp Elite I've been using since January 2016 but I'd have to say that the Samsung is much faster - also that the screen response is so much better in this J7 model (even with the glass protection I placed on the screen). My hubby bought me this for my upcoming 60th birthday! GREAT present for me.....all mine! Thank you 'shopcelldeals' for selling this at a reasonable price that was affordable. Recommended.",

                "review_text": "I've had some time to kick my phone around (figuratively and literally), and I'm really impressed with this phone. It's value priced, but still very functional. I switched from a Samsung Galaxy SIII, and I feel that this was definitely an upgrade. While the Moto G3 has less memory (8GB) and storage (both internally, and it only supports up to 32GB SDHC micro card), the better processor makes a huge difference. I don't play games, but I do still run a fair number of productivity apps (the biggest being Polaris Office and TeamViewer) and they benefit greatly from the quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 CPUs performance. The SIII would always hang up when running bigger applications, and would always freeze up when pulling up the SwiftKey keyboard. Some apps were almost unusable on the SIII because of these stutters and freezing (ProCapture was the biggest problem). I'm really impressed at how good the camera sensor is. The color, contrast, and brightness of the screen are also incredible. I've had better luck with 4G data, though I do notice a little less speed on Wifi after losing 5 gHz connectivity. The audio on the phone is an improvement, with the two larger speakers on the front of the device. Call clarity has been about as good as the SIII, in my tests. The phone construction is very solid, and seems very rugged in general. I was very happy with the upgrade, from the Galaxy SIII. For my purposes, it's a great phone. I like that it's water resistant, and it performs very well. My girlfriend ended up upgrading to the same phone, from an HTC Desire 816, and she's very happy with the performance boost. It's definitely NOT a flagship phone, and it's only suitable for lower-end or older games. This is not a power user phone, by any means. The smaller storage is probably the biggest limitation. While it hasn't greatly affected me, as I only have a few big apps, but it's definitely the most profound limitation of the phone. If you don't need the power and space of a flagship phone, but still want a very high-quality all-weather handset, I think this is an excellent option. The price jumps around, so if you wait around for a small discount, this is probably one of the better deals on the current phone market. It suits my needs very well, and - having survived being caught in a few big downpours - has been worth every penny. Sept. 2016 Update: For a few weeks, I was having problems with the SD Micro card becoming unmounted, or write problems on the SD Micro card. I assumed it was loosening up in the case (a problem I had with an older phone). Eventually it would refuse to re-mount, despite all attempts. It turned out the phone was having specific problems with the Samsung 32GB EVO Plus Class 10 Micro SDHC, that several other Moto G3 users experienced. I replaced it with a Class 6 Kingston card, and it's been working flawlessly ever since, without any noticeable decrease in read/write speeds.",

                "review_text": "This phone is one of the best I have had from Virgin Mobile, and know it would be better with T-Mobile or another GSM carrier with the extra specs those add. The camera is very nice for such a cheap phone, 13mp in the back, 5mp in the front. Works well in relatively low lighting and doesn't begin to look grainy until it's obviously much too dark, such as outside in the night with a fire for just light like the stone ages. Anyway, it's not the best camera, but definitely better than the LG Volt and LG G Stylo I had had before this one. The screen isn't brilliantly bright and crisp, but I promise it doesn't look horribly. The screen is big, but not too big, more comfortable than the LG G Stylo in my personal opinion, but if you like \"Phablets\", this is a big small, but you'd probably get used to it. The ram is only 1gb in the Virgin Mobile edition, and only 4.5gb of internal storage available to the user, even though it advertises 8gb. The other phone with the GSM carriers have 2gb of ram, and 16gb or storage with only 10gb or so left for the users accessibility. It comes with Lollipop, although I am sure the Marshmellow update wouldn't be long to hit considering it did hit the LG G Stylo quickly, and this phone is the 2015 successor of the Moto G lineups. The phone is able to be rooted, although I do not advise for it will void your warranty with Motorola and possibly Virgin Mobile, so you should know what you are doing. However, this should be brought up because Virgin Mobile carries a variety of cheap phones, but they are mostly LG. LG should not be rooted because they end up killing over and are touchy. Motorola is more laid back, and it should be noted so people know what they should and shouldn't if they are not experienced and want to try new things. Yes, this phone is water resistant, but not water proof. You can not swim with it and epect to use it under water. This is purely for accidents only. You can use this near water and if something splashes on it, it will be fine. You must remember to seal the back near the camera and the edges, or it will completely useless and you will lose your phone to water damage. The biggest con is the bit of crashes I have experienced on such little use. The play store crashes immediately when trying to type, and many other things end up crashing. This may not be a problem to all, but to me it was and should be noted. This does have an LED to those who care about that little helpful feature, however it is not able to be used for anything other than battery purposes, so you don't get anything very helpful from it. There is the feature Moto Display which shows your notifications on the screen in a specific way and there are settings for you to mess with. Over all this phone is a very great phone for the price and something that people can greatly appreciate for a low budget.",

I was worried that it wouldn't be sufficient for my needs but after installing my favorite apps I still have 2 gb left over. This phone replaced my 4 year old Galaxy S2. Comparing the two phones is like apples and oranges. Yes they are both phones but the Moto G does everything better than the S2 even if it has less internal memory (The S2 has 16GB) and lacks the NFC feature of the S2. The trade off is more than worth it. The Moto is faster, takes higher quality photos (in daylight) with a faster shutter speed, the speakerphone is really loud, and the battery life is amazing. After a full day of use my battery only dropped down to 70%. I didn't play any video games or use FB during that time but I did watch You Tube and used other apps that would have killed the battery on my S2 in less than 3 hours.",

Either one works. :) I was terrified but I took a chance and ordered a Large rather than an XL. After reading many reviews I was convinced to at least try the Large. Since it's a Prime item, an exchange or return would be easy anyway. The dress arrived less than an hour ago and it fits perfectly. It is very slimming and can be worn out with friends, church, and most important to me work. The length is just at the knee, maybe 1/2 an inch at the most above it. The asymmetrical cut is interesting in a beautiful way. It does not look like whoever made the dress drank too much coffee and slipped with the scissors one too many times. I'm planning on pairing it with grey knee boots and scarf as in the picture to make the outfit really pop. The material is very soft and although on the thinner side, it's good quality and not see through at all. I hate slips because I live on the GA/SC line and it's Hot! The winters have some colder days but boots, thick boot socks, dress, slip, and a scarf would give me hot flashes! I am investing in boot toppers this year though and now can remove the slip as well. We have a WINNER!!! My husband loves it and said an XL would have been droopy. Curvy girls, this is flattering and hides flaws below the waist. I hope my review is helpful because I rely on them myself when buying clothes. Update as of 3/14/17- I have taken care of these dresses (I have several) and they still look brand new after much wear. They have not shrunk, faded, lost their shape, and there is no pilling. This dress is literally the perfect dress. I stand behind my original review 100%!",

                "review_text": "I want to be perfectly clear on this review. I am reviewing the \"ZANZEA Batwing Sleeve\" shirt. I have found that on amazon, there are an enormous amount of items that use the EXACT same picture that's used on this item. The reviews are significantly different and the color choices are different too. THE PICTURE: It's a blonde, thin woman wearing grey leggings and a white tank under the shirt. The shirt in the image is artificially colored, meaning the same image is used for all of the color choices but the image was altered to show the different colors. The model is not wearing each color. MY REVIEW OF ZANZEA: I love this shirt. I'm short (5'3\") and wear a Large or XL shirt normally. I'm a 38D. I bought this shirt both in XL (2) and in L. The XL was actually a bit large. the L fits perfectly. It covers my butt which means I can wear this with leggings instead of jeggings, although I wear it with both. It's not thin - it is thick but not bulky like a sweater. The bat wings are long and hang down past my wrists. It's super comfortable. I'm tempted to buy one in every color. I might even order a medium - it's that big. I love this shirt. I have it in black, orange and green (which is more of an aquamarine than a kelly green). WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ITEMS FROM OTHER BRANDS? I have no idea why the picture is identical but the reviews vary GREATLY. the Zanzea seems a big on me but other reviews state the shirt is thin or small and I didn't experience that at all. In an effort to help, I'll post all of the information together. I'll include the brand name, the colors available (not what colors are listed, but the colors I see, which don't really match the description), as well as any conflicting information in the reviews. I hope this helps!

The one thing I will say is I recommend sizing down one from your normal size. I usually wear a US medium, but after looking at the size chart and seeing the bust is 155 cm (about 61\") on the size small, I knew the medium would be too big if I wanted it like the model. I normally wear a 36DD on top, so 61\" would be more than enough room to still give that loose fit as shown. The material this is made from is a very nice lightweight sweater material so it's very comfy and soft. I like that the neckline is loose enough to be worn off should with a tank layered underneath. The length was perfect. Longer in the back and shorter in the front. In the back it's long enough to cover my butt so can be worn with leggings or skinny jeans for a really cute look. I ordered the blue color which in person looks exactly as shown on my computer. I am very happy with this top in every possible way. Cute style, good fit and nice quality. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, just do your measuring first and compare to the size chart to get the fit you expect.",

Notice that Photos for all these tops are exactly the same, and while all are \"oversized\" in design, there are numerous differences even within the same brand name. I purchased 3 Uget tops, but only one is actually an off-shoulder design. Because of the price, and b/c I like the general style, I purchased 9 in the hopes of getting 3 or 4 that I really liked. Some have a deeper cut neckline, some sleeves are waaay long, others shorter, some shirts have seams down the back and on sleeves, others are seamless. Of the nine I've received, 2 are a cotton blend, one is nylon (& not at all \"breathable, as advertised), and the others are a synthetic fabric which causes an itchy rash on my arms. Refer to attached photos(Zanea green/Uget pink) for an idea of what I mean. Zanea has a seam down the back, Uget does not. Zanea has a solid sleeve and it's an inch or two longer. Uget has a pieced sleeve. The Exlura I have in black is Nylon fabric and has 3/4 sleeves. Good Luck.",

I then went back to my room and ordered the slim fit from amazon to arrive the next morning. 1. Someone criticized this for being too thin and see-through -- but that's perfectly normal for a poplin shirt, and you see it in ultra-high end shirts like my Yves St. Laurent poplin shirt (I'm talking $300 per shirt). Poplin is a very thin weave, and it's supposed to look silky smooth (compare to broadcloth, oxford etc. which are thick weaves and which look relatively coarse). It's more for summer wear, and works particularly well if you have to wear your suit all day. And yes always wear these with an undershirt (but then again if you're going casual in the summer, no tie and top button open, and you have a good body, then I guess you can just wear it without an undershirt. You see male models pulling off that sort of look). Any way, I can see not liking the shirt. But not liking it because it's too thin and see-through is just off-base. That's what it's supposed to do. 2. But this is not completely perfect. The fit is a little large, so definitely get the fitted (and not normal) and maybe the extra slim if they make that. That being said, I haven't seen what happens to these after 10 washes. 3. The cut is also not super-modern. It's fine though. It's like a normal cut, which you might prefer if you don't want to be too stylish / like a dandy etc. 4. For $20 this is a ridiculous deal.",

(Before these shoes I only owned thick boots and flip-flops for the last year) I wanted a pair of Sperry's since they are renowned for their quality craftsmanship. On every pair of shoes I've owed I have warn through the back. Sperry's solved this issue by sowing a small overlap in the material which makes it virtually impossible to wear through the backs. They are a slightly more expensive boat shoe than what you could find but the longevity in quality will make up for it. My major concern with this shoe is the fabric in the sole. There is a fabric that overlaps the rest of the sole and has started to curl up in both of my shoes.

One more thing about the velcro... if not properly overlapped can irritate any skin it rubs up against. So keep that in mind if you are wearing it with jeans or a skirt with any top that doesn't fit into them (aka crop tops) You really can't be it for the cost. just make sure to size it right, that will be the only problem.

I didn't unlace it completely, just loosened it slightly and after that the fit was terrible. It rolled and bunched and I didn't end up using it.

It does have velcro in the back, which I was concerned about what with the stretching and the holding-in and all, but it's very good velcro that not only holds tight, it disappears within the closure and you can't even see it.

We go several times a year and I have always put their clothes in a huge bag with mine or used one bag for them to share which would lead to the 4 year old digging for his clothes and mixing them all up. I wanted them to have their own bags from now on, especially for the 4 year old because he now packs his won clothes (using a checklist of pictures) and then he can get himself dressed on the trip without mixing up his clothes with his brother's. Note that this is about the size of a regular/adult size backpack with wheels and handle. It's not really a luggage or suitcase per se. How much can you fit? For the 4 year old, I was able to fit a week's worth of clothes in the summer - 7 tops, 7 shorts, 7 underwear, 7 socks, 3 pajamas to wear twice each, and swim shorts. I wash all the laundry on the 6th day if we stay a week or more. In colder weather it will be less that fits in here due to the clothes being bigger. I used it in the fall and was able to fit about 4-5 long sleeve shirts and 2 short sleeve shirts, 5-6 pants, 7 underwear, 7 socks, and 3 pajamas. For the 17 month old, I was able to fit a week's worth of clothes for both the summer and fall trip, with room for 2 aden and anais muslin swaddle blankets (he uses as his bedtime blankies) and an Ikea Spoka nightlight with the charger. I think I also had an extra outfit for him just in case. Also, I put the diapers and wipes in my bag, there's no way to fit a week of those in here with clothes. It pushes the bag to it's limits for a full week trip, but anything less than that and you would gain some room for a toy or books. We bought the little matching backpacks for them to pack toys and books in though and that works for us. Granted, its 2 more bags to carry, pack in the car, and keep track of however then the toys and books are more portable to take around and they don't have to dig in the luggage for those items. Usually the luggage is upstairs in the guest room and the backpack is downstairs in the living room, so it makes sense for our trips.",

Overall I am ok with it, not extremely pleased due to the small size but that is more my fault than theirs, so just make sure you do a better reading than me before ordering and decide if that size is good for you and you will have a nice looking sturdy product.",

This piece does not feature a sweeping second hand which will begin my pursuit of finding a piece for under $300 that does. I am open to suggestions. The bracelet was easy to adjust and the links look heavy even though they are not. The lum on the hands have a green tinge and I have not had the luck of them really glowing in the dark. I was a bit surprised that the bezel rotates, a feature I will not use. Also the magnifier over the date does not magnify the number to its size. This is my first homage watch and I think $50 was a good price.",

The watch is very thick and heavy, and the band would have required removal of a bunch of these big links. So I have no idea if it's really waterproof, but I sent it back. Update... well, whaddaya know, I ended up getting an Invicta watch very similar to this one as a gift, and -- recognizing now as I did not when I wrote the above review -- that huge watches are the IN thing these days, I love it. The one I got is the Invicta Women's 2961 Pro Diver Collection \"Lady Abyss\" Two-Tone Dive Watch, which costs about twice as much as this watch here.",

I have not tried to test how waterproof this watch is but it seems legit. Cons: To many this may seem like a smaller watch then they expected (aprox. 1 inch diameter watch face) but for me it was fine, the links are a little difficult to adjust to smaller wrist sizes (I tried to adjust it myself and had to bring it to a jeweler). I would give this five stars but having to bring it to a jeweler just to adjust the links threw me off.",

These is my third attempt to purchase one for my wife's birthday. Every single one I have received has been defective. The first two the winder would not screw down which is necessary to be water tight. This most recent one when she pulled the winder out to set it 60 seconds after opening the box, the whole thing pulled out of the watch completely. I'm done.

The skirt, despite my worries, fits surprisingly well! It may be because of the stretchy material for the waist/suspenders but it catered to my body and it isn't too tight or too big. The only complaint that I have is that one of the waist straps is sewn on backwards and all the loose threads but since I'm a seamstress its no big deal to me. zipping the skirt up from the back was difficult so I just put it on over my head without unzipping it. Thank goodness the zipper is strong! I've had plenty of zippers come down or break because of tightness but this one is perfect. Definitely recommend XL size to any plus size women! Be warned, the skirt is a bit short. I'm short myself, only 5'0\" and the skirt barely covers my butt. Maybe an inch past it but maybe adding lace to it or wearing shorts will be fine.",

So I loved that! They are also adorable and incredibly soft. The snap closure is perfect because they are harder for little hands to undo or pull off. And there are two snaps for fitting. I may be purchasing again in a larger size if need be. Definitely recommend. I wish they made them with skidders on the bottom for walking around the house in.
